  <!--
  In order to use images, they must be in the same folder as the html file, or the file path must be stated in the src.
  Height and width scale proportionally, so no need to change width. Both are measured in pixels.
  Alt is alternative text to be read outloud by a screen reader, for those with visual impairments.
  Title gives a pop up box whenever your cursor is placed on the image.
  Images do not need to be closed

  Controls are a boolean attribute, that do not need to equal anything, which give a control panel for the audio.
  Autoplay is also a boolean attribute which allow music to play upon the opening of the website.
